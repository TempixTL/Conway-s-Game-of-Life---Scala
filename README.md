# Conway's Game of Life - Scala
This is code for a simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life][conway wiki] in the [Scala][scala webpage] language.
It requires the [ScalaFX][scalafx webpage] library to run, which you can download from their website. It is a Scala wrapper for the JavaFX library, and allowed me to make a GUI simply and easily.

To compile and run the program, simply type `scala -cp [path/to/scalafx.jar] GameOfLife.scala`.

###### This code was created by me during my enrollement in Mark Lewis' "Principles of Computer Science I" class at Trinity University in 2017. It is one of my first Scala programs, please show me mercy.
